## Otaku Search

During my time at General Assembly, my friend Sky and I used to have an inside joke about search bars. Being the junior developers we were, we greatly underestimated the amount of time and effort it would take to build one. During the design phase of a group project, we played around with the idea of building one and saved it until the very last minute. 

It did not get built. 

Instead, anytime we worked together on a project, we would joke about building one and never actually do it. So over the past few weeks, I finally decided to give it a shot- and guess what? IT'S FOR ANIME. Here you'll find "Otaku Search," a quick and simple search bar designed to help users discover new anime.  

## Technologies Used

- Vanilla JS
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap CDN 
- Animate.style

A few of my previous projects felt very cookie-cutter in terms of design, so I decided to approach this project with more color in order to help spark more orginality. I also wanted to brush up on my CSS framework skills which is why I went with Bootstrap.
